To run the server execute the following command inside the proj1 directory:

	./proj2

You should receive the output:

	Listening on port 8080...

Then, navigate to the driver directory and open a different terminal. Once there, execute the
following command to run the tests:

	./driver

This will send a series of requests to the server. The output from both the server and driver are
saved in the file 'standard-output.txt' in the proj1 directory.
